 * struct udevice - An instance of a driver
 *
 * This holds information about a device, which is a driver bound to a
 * particular port or peripheral (essentially a driver instance).
 *
 * A device will come into existence through a 'bind' call, either due to
 * a U_BOOT_DEVICE() macro (in which case platdata is non-NULL) or a node
 * in the device tree (in which case of_offset is >= 0). In the latter case
 * we translate the device tree information into platdata in a function
 * implemented by the driver ofdata_to_platdata method (called just before the
 * probe method if the device has a device tree node.
 *
 * All three of platdata, priv and uclass_priv can be allocated by the
 * driver, or you can use the auto_alloc_size members of struct driver and
 * struct uclass_driver to have driver model do this automatically.
 *
 * @driver: The driver used by this device
 * @name: Name of device, typically the FDT node name
 * @platdata: Configuration data for this device
 * @parent_platdata: The parent bus's configuration data for this device
 * @uclass_platdata: The uclass's configuration data for this device
 * @node: Reference to device tree node for this device
 * @driver_data: Driver data word for the entry that matched this device with
 *		its driver
 * @parent: Parent of this device, or NULL for the top level device
 * @priv: Private data for this device
 * @uclass: Pointer to uclass for this device
 * @uclass_priv: The uclass's private data for this device
 * @parent_priv: The parent's private data for this device
 * @uclass_node: Used by uclass to link its devices
 * @child_head: List of children of this device
 * @sibling_node: Next device in list of all devices
 * @flags: Flags for this device DM_FLAG_...
 * @req_seq: Requested sequence number for this device (-1 = any)
 * @seq: Allocated sequence number for this device (-1 = none). This is set up
 * when the device is probed and will be unique within the device's uclass.
 * @devres_head: List of memory allocations associated with this device.
 *		When CONFIG_DEVRES is enabled, devm_kmalloc() and friends will
 *		add to this list. Memory so-allocated will be freed
 *		automatically when the device is removed / unbound

/**
 * struct driver - A driver for a feature or peripheral
 *
 * This holds methods for setting up a new device, and also removing it.
 * The device needs information to set itself up - this is provided either
 * by platdata or a device tree node (which we find by looking up
 * matching compatible strings with of_match).
 *
 * Drivers all belong to a uclass, representing a class of devices of the
 * same type. Common elements of the drivers can be implemented in the uclass,
 * or the uclass can provide a consistent interface to the drivers within
 * it.
 *
 * @name: Device name
 * @id: Identifies the uclass we belong to
 * @of_match: List of compatible strings to match, and any identifying data
 * for each.
 * @bind: Called to bind a device to its driver
 * @probe: Called to probe a device, i.e. activate it
 * @remove: Called to remove a device, i.e. de-activate it
 * @unbind: Called to unbind a device from its driver
 * @ofdata_to_platdata: Called before probe to decode device tree data
 * @child_post_bind: Called after a new child has been bound
 * @child_pre_probe: Called before a child device is probed. The device has
 * memory allocated but it has not yet been probed.
 * @child_post_remove: Called after a child device is removed. The device
 * has memory allocated but its device_remove() method has been called.
 * @priv_auto_alloc_size: If non-zero this is the size of the private data
 * to be allocated in the device's ->priv pointer. If zero, then the driver
 * is responsible for allocating any data required.
 * @platdata_auto_alloc_size: If non-zero this is the size of the
 * platform data to be allocated in the device's ->platdata pointer.
 * This is typically only useful for device-tree-aware drivers (those with
 * an of_match), since drivers which use platdata will have the data
 * provided in the U_BOOT_DEVICE() instantiation.
 * @per_child_auto_alloc_size: Each device can hold private data owned by
 * its parent. If required this will be automatically allocated if this
 * value is non-zero.
 * @per_child_platdata_auto_alloc_size: A bus likes to store information about
 * its children. If non-zero this is the size of this data, to be allocated
 * in the child's parent_platdata pointer.
 * @ops: Driver-specific operations. This is typically a list of function
 * pointers defined by the driver, to implement driver functions required by
 * the uclass.
 * @flags: driver flags - see DM_FLAGS_...
